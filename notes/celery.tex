    \section {Celery Glossary}

\textbf {ack} \quad Short for acknowledged. \\
\textbf {acknowledged} \quad Workers acknowledge messages to signify that a
message has been handled. Failing to acknowledge a message will cause the
message to be redelivered. Exactly when a transaction is considered a failure
varies by transport. In AMQP the transaction fails when the connection/channel
is closed (or lost), but in Redis/SQS the transaction times out after a
configurable amount of time (the visibility\_timeout). \\
\textbf {apply} \quad Originally a synonym to call but used to signify that a
function is executed by the current process. \\
\textbf {billiard} \quad Fork of the Python multiprocessing library containing
improvements required by Celery. \\
\textbf {calling} \quad Sends a task message so that the task function is
executed by a worker. \\
\textbf {context} \quad The context of a task contains information like the id
of the task, it’s arguments and what queue it was delivered to. It can be
accessed as the tasks request attribute. See Task Request \\
\textbf {early ack} \quad Short for early acknowledgment \\
\textbf {early acknowledgment} \quad Task is acknowledged just-in-time before
being executed, meaning the task won’t be redelivered to another worker if the
machine loses power, or the worker instance is abruptly killed, mid-execution.
Configured using task\_acks\_late. \\
\textbf {ETA} \quad “Estimated Time of Arrival”, in Celery and Google Task Queue,
etc., used as the term for a delayed message that should not be processed
until the specified ETA time. See ETA and Countdown.  \\
\textbf {executing} \quad Workers execute task requests.  \\
\textbf {idempotent} \quad Idempotence is a mathematical property that describes a
function that can be called multiple times without changing the result.
Practically it means that a function can be repeated many times without
unintended effects, but not necessarily side-effect free in the pure sense
(compare to nullipotent). \\
 \\
\textbf {kombu}    Python messaging library used by Celery to send and receive
messages. \\
\textbf {late ack}    Short for late acknowledgment \\
\textbf {late acknowledgment}    Task is acknowledged after execution (both if
successful, or if the task is raising an error), which means the task will be
redelivered to another worker in the event of the machine losing power, or the
worker instance being killed mid-execution. Configured using task\_acks\_late.
\\
\textbf {nullipotent} \quad describes a function that’ll have the same effect,
and give the same result, even if called zero or multiple times (side-effect
free). A stronger version of idempotent. \\
\textbf {pidbox} \quad A process mailbox, used to implement remote control
commands. \\
\textbf {prefetch count} \quad Maximum number of unacknowledged messages a
consumer can hold and if exceeded the transport shouldn’t deliver any more
messages to that consumer. See Prefetch Limits. \\
\textbf {prefetch multiplier} \quad The prefetch count is configured by using
the worker\_prefetch\_multiplier setting, which is multiplied by the number of
pool slots (threads/processes/greenthreads). \\
\textbf {reentrant} \quad describes a function that can be interrupted in the
middle of execution (e.g., by hardware interrupt or signal), and then safely
called again later. Reentrancy isn’t the same as idempotence as the return
value doesn’t have to be the same given the same inputs, and a reentrant
function may have side effects as long as it can be interrupted; An idempotent
function is always reentrant, but the reverse may not be true. \\
\textbf {request} \quad Task messages are converted to requests within the
worker. The request information is also available as the task’s context (the
task.request attribute). \\
